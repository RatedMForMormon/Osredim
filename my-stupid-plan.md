**DISCLAIMER** I use the name "Unity" but any game design software can be used to learn development, and we will likely use Unreal and some other programs to proof some concepts and learn game development.


This game needs to be properly designed, and this will be the raw tasks file to use to determine our milestones.

# Stage One - Design and Planning
most of the design can be found in the tasks and world-building files.

What I want done most of all is a working prototype, from there, we can develop and make the game more comprehensive and full, that's what Phase One is, We'll work out what Phase two is later.

The game development needs to be planned or it will not ever get done.

# Stage Two - Learning
I don't know nearly enough about games to develop something of this scale, so I need to learn about game development so I can actually get a proper workflow.

## Tasks - This is the pre-workout to making the game
 - learn MonoGame and another code-heavy game engine, I can't remember what it's called
 - learn about making a game engine?
 - learn about the tools that are currently available to game developers, Unity works, but I want to find as many pre-built programs to streamline the process, if nothing is found, we move to task 2.
 - This in mind, become familiar with said tools and use them until we are absolutely comfortable using them for many situations.
 - Develop the required modules we learned we need from the previous task.
# Stage Three - Heavy Lifting
Here, the game will be made, in stage two, we will develop small projects that utilize each of the Unity packages until we are comfortable with them, and we only start true development on the game once we have made all the required modules from stage two.

We will also create any modules that may need to be made here.
