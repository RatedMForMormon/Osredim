# Welcome to Project Osredim
Glad you're here, lets catch you up on how this is going to work.
# Task system
Currently all of Project Osredim is in my head, and I am in the process of breaking it down into a bunch of little tasks for me/you to complete

I can always use some help with creating the tasks if they are not specific enough (or if they're just terible in general)

# The game

A brief overview of the game

## Osredim
It's a world that was created by an all-powerful God, all humans are called Ihodan and are the ultimate creation of said God. The Ihodan were created to progress infinitely so they could eventually become like the God that created them.

It's an age that's a hybrid of midieval and modern, the "lore reason" being that magic is easier applied to singular items, but machinery is culminations of hundreds of little things when it takes a heap of effort to produce a single enchanted item. machinery has its uses, and so does magic

### Magic system
There are six schools of magic (technically eight) and players have a certain proficiency with them, the higher the proficiency, the higher the effect of the spell.

there are also "effects" which can be unlocked in various ways, after unlocking an effect, you can apply it to anything you wish, and depending on what you apply it to, it will have different effects. Example: applying healing to a weapon will heal you for a certain percentage of its damage, and applying it to armor increases your natural healing rate.

### Story
The current working story is that a hundred years prior to the player's appearance, Dema, the King of Evil, was kiled by Tosotris, a powerful hero. However, instead of getting rid of the constant evil power over the world, it simply disorganized it, causing evil manifestations to randomly appear. The current struggle of the world is to find a way to destroy or contain the evil magic that runs rampant across the globe.

There's no current final boss, but the story follows the player and his bouts with evil, whether he chooses to control it, or destroy it.
