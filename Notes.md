# Osredim Game

In order to make my idea into a game, I need to break it down into tasks. In order to do this, I am going to break it down into it's core components and then break it down further.

## Color System
There are 6 colors, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. Each one has it's own attribute to it, and with those 6 attributes, practically any skill can be created or countered.

### Proficiency
The player starts with 1% proficiency in each color, and as it increases, the spells they use with that color get stronger

### Synergy
This is a color wheel, and using multiple colors can come with deficits if you use two colors that are too far away from each other. On the other hand, using colors that are right next to each other can have a positive effect.

With every character, you are able to choose one color that isn't affected by this, however, it will stop all synergy, not just the negative synergy.

### Red - Destruction
ANYTHING to do with destroying things, whether that's enemy hp, strength, buffs, or weapons/armor.

#### Red skills
This is a list of red skills

##### Destroy Attribute
Destroy [Select amount] [Stamina/Mana/HP]

### Orange - Amplification
All the direct buffing skills will be here

### Yellow - Creation
All crafting skills go here, along with summoning.

### Green - Restoration
Pretty obviously going to be healing, but not just that, it's the direct opposite of destruction.

### Blue - Suppression
Stops things

### Purple - Manipulation
Manipulate the flow of mana

### Colorless - Transportation
This is for teleportation/inventories

#### Backpacks
backbacks are items that either reduce weight, or have a set item limit.

##### Weight reduction
These backpacks can store an unlimited amount of items, but they don't negate weight, weight is just reduced by a certain percentage.

##### Item Limit
These backbacks completely negate weight, but have a unique item limit.
 
#### Teleportation
Teleportation allows you to teleport to a general area that you have or haven't been before. This only costs mana, and no additional resources.

#### Gates
Gates allow you to teleport to a specific, chosen location, but only if you have directly traveled there before and have a clear traveled path, it also costs a lot of resources to change the exit point of a gate. there are a limited number of gates depending on your efficiency/proficiency

## Effects
You will be able to collect various effects throughout the game, and these can be applied to just about anything.

### Efficiency
effects have a set number depending on your level, but that number is decreased if your efficiency is low with the specific effect.

For example, you apply a bleed effect to the enemy. The bleed effect says it deals 12 damage a second, however, you only have 50% efficiency, so it only deals 6 damage a second.

You cannot increase effect efficiency with purchased spells, those spells will have their own efficiency.

### Usage
Effects can be used almost anywhere as long as you have it unlocked, however, learning a spell that uses one of these effects will not gove you the effect itself, limiting the effect to that one spell.


### How to unlock
Effects are unlocked as loot drops, and can only be used by you and the party that you were with. (if you already have the bleed effect, you can give it to a party member)

## Spell Configuration
With the various Effects you can unlock, you can apply them to spells to create new ones, and you are able to then save those configurations into a few keybinds
### Spellbook
Your spellbook will have real usage, depending on the level of the book you use, you can save a certain number of configurations, a whole lot more than keybinds would give. You are also able to switch out the keybinds, and are also able to select keybind configs within the spellbook.
### Sale
You are able to teach spell configurations to other players, and they are able to use them even if they don't have the effects unlocked. You can sell entire spellbooks.

By using another person's spells, you gain color proficiency at 5% the normal rate, you gain experience points at 50%
