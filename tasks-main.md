# Tasks
This file will contain all the tasks that need done to make this game a reality. I am using a method where I break the game into 2 things, then break those things down into 2 things and so forth until I have something simple enough to be programmed.

There will be links to other files which contain more topics, and eventually you will find a task that needs done

This is still not perfect, and I could use help with creating the tasks

# !IMPORTANT!
Complete the LOWEST level of tasks before attempting to complete a higher one
